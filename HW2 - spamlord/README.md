# Homework 2: Spamlord

## Introduction

This homework is based on a similar homework called SpamLord from the Stanford NLP course. On the web, many people who want to give their email addresses or phone numbers for people to contact them will try to make it hard for spammers to automatically search text for email addresses and phone numbers by giving non-standard forms of them, sometimes called obfuscation.

My task here is to write regular expressions to match these obfuscated email addresses and phone numbers, while keeping the number of false positives as low as possible. Also I've proposed some ideas for better obfuscation.

## Final Results

I matched all of the 119 obfuscated phone numbers with 0 false positives.
I've also matched 108/119 email addresses, with 2 false positives and 9 false negatives.
