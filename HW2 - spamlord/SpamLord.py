This function takes in a filename along with the file object and
scans its contents against regex patterns. It returns a list of
(filename, type, value) tuples where type is either an 'e' or a 'p'
for e-mail or phone, and value is the formatted phone number or e-mail.
The canonical formats are:
     (name, 'p', '###-###-#####')
     (name, 'e', 'someone@something')
If the numbers you submit are formatted differently they will not
match the gold answers

TODO
For Part 3, if you have added other lists, you may should add
additional for loops that match the patterns in those lists
and produce correctly formatted results to append to the res list.
