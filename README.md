Here are some highlights of the work I've done for the course

## Homework 2: Spamlord (Regular expressions)

This homework is based on a similar homework called SpamLord from the Stanford NLP course. On the web, many people who want to give their email addresses or phone numbers for people to contact them will try to make it hard for spammers to automatically search text for email addresses and phone numbers by giving non-standard forms of them, sometimes called obfuscation.

My task here is to write regular expressions to match these obfuscated email addresses and phone numbers, while keeping the number of false positives as low as possible.

## Lab 11: Bigram and POS tag feature sets and cross-validation in the NLTK

In this lab, I learned to use bigram features and POS (Part-of-Speech) tag features for classification. I have also learned to use cross-validation to evaluate the performances of the classification models.
