#Homework 2: Spamlord


This homework is based on a similar homework called SpamLord from the Stanford NLP course. On the web, many people who want to give their email addresses or phone numbers for people to contact them will try to make it hard for spammers to automatically search text for email addresses and phone numbers by giving non-standard forms of them, sometimes called obfuscation.
